## How It Works

### Alert lifecycle

1. Configure one or more **alerts**, each linked to an entity + condition
2. When an entity matches the condition (and any extra `conditions` rules), the alert becomes **active**
3. Active alerts are **sorted by priority** (1=most critical)
4. The card **displays** the current alert and **auto-cycles** through multiple active alerts
5. Use ◀ / ▶ buttons (or swipe) to jump between alerts manually
6. **Tap** or **hold** the card to execute configured actions
7. **Snooze** any alert with 💤 — one tap for fixed duration, or choose from the menu
8. **📋** opens the alert history with timestamps
9. When no alerts are active and `show_when_clear: true`, the card shows the **all-clear state** (message, clock, or weather)

### Transition animations

When multiple alerts are active, the card cycles using the selected animation:

| Animation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `fold` *(default)* | 3D page-turn along the X axis |
| `slide` | Horizontal push left/right |
| `fade` | Cross-dissolve opacity fade |
| `flip` | RotateY card flip |
| `zoom` | Scale punch in/out |
| `glitch` | Clip-path jitter digital noise |
| `bounce` | Elastic spring from below |
| `swing` | RotateZ pendulum |
| `blur` | Gaussian dissolve |
| `split` | Vertical split (top up, bottom down) |
| `roll` | RotateY + translateX combined roll |
| `curtain` | Opens from center (theater curtain) |

### Manual alert navigation

When 2 or more alerts are active, **◀** and **▶** buttons appear on the left/right edges on hover (first touch on mobile). Clicking jumps to the previous/next alert and resets the auto-cycle timer. On mobile, **left/right swipe** also navigates (if `swipe_to_snooze` is enabled, left-swipe keeps its snooze behaviour and only right-swipe navigates).

### Secondary entity value

Display a live entity value as a second line below the alert message:

```yaml
- entity: sensor.open_zones
  operator: "!="
  state: "0"
  message: "Zones open"
  secondary_entity: sensor.open_zones_list
  secondary_attribute: zone_names   # optional — read an attribute instead of state
```

### tap_action / hold_action / double_tap_action

Standard Lovelace interactions — tap, hold (500 ms), or double-tap the whole card to trigger any action:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.front_door
  state: "on"
  message: "Front door open"
  tap_action:
    action: more-info
    entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
  hold_action:
    action: navigate
    navigation_path: /lovelace/security
  double_tap_action:
    action: call-service
    service: lock.lock
    target:
      entity_id: lock.front_door
```

> When `double_tap_action` is set, a single tap waits 300 ms to distinguish the two gestures.

Supported action types: `call-service`, `navigate`, `more-info`, `url`, `none`.

### on_change — trigger on any state change

Fire an alert whenever an entity changes state, regardless of the `operator`/`state` condition. The alert stays visible until the next state change, or auto-dismisses after `auto_dismiss_after` seconds:

```yaml
- entity: media_player.living_room
  on_change: true
  auto_dismiss_after: 15
  message: "Now playing: {state}"
  theme: notification
```

### time_range — restrict to a time window

Show an alert only within a specific time window. Supports midnight crossing:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.front_door
  state: "on"
  message: "Door open at night!"
  time_range:
    from: "22:00"
    to: "07:00"
  theme: intruder
```

The card re-evaluates at each minute boundary so alerts appear and disappear on time without any entity state change. Leave both fields empty for always-active.

### visible_to — per-alert user filter

Restrict an alert to specific Home Assistant users without separate cards or conditional wrappers:

```yaml
- entity: sensor.server_load
  state: "high"
  message: "Server load critical"
  visible_to: admin          # admin | non_admin | "John" | ["John", "Maria"]
```

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `admin` | Admins only |
| `non_admin` | Non-admin users only |
| `"Display Name"` | Single user by display name |
| `["Name1", "Name2"]` | Multiple users by display name |
| *(omit)* | Shown to everyone |

### All-clear widget (clock / weather)

When `show_when_clear: true` is set and no alerts are active, the card can show an animated clock or live weather display instead of a plain text message:

```yaml
show_when_clear: true
clear_display_mode: weather_clock     # message | clock | weather | weather_clock
clear_weather_entity: weather.home
```

| Mode | Display |
|------|---------|
| `message` | Standard all-clear text message (default) |
| `clock` | Animated digital clock with date, deep navy background and blue glow |
| `weather` | Animated weather background with condition, temperature, wind speed, humidity |
| `weather_clock` | Weather background + clock badge in top-right corner |

Weather modes show full animated particle backgrounds (sun rays, stars/moon/aurora, floating clouds, fog, wind streaks, rain, snow, hail, lightning, exceptional). All weather info and the clock are rendered as frosted-glass corner badges so the animated sky stays fully visible.

### Snooze

Tap 💤 on any active alert to snooze it. Two modes (configurable in General tab):

- **Menu** *(default)* — choose 1h / 4h / 8h / 24h from a menu on the card
- **Fixed duration** — configure 30min / 1h / 4h / 8h / 24h for immediate one-tap snooze

Snoozed alerts persist in `localStorage` and the card restores them automatically when the duration expires. A small amber 💤 pill appears when some alerts are snoozed while others remain active — tap it to resume all.

### snooze_action

Execute a Lovelace action when the 💤 button is tapped, in addition to snoozing. Useful for resetting sensors:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.mailbox
  state: "on"
  message: "Mail arrived"
  snooze_action:
    action: call-service
    service: input_boolean.turn_off
    target:
      entity_id: input_boolean.mailbox_flag
```

### Alert history

Tap 📋 to flip the card and view a timestamped log of every alert that became active. Includes a Clear button. History is stored in `localStorage` (configurable max: 25 / 50 / 100 / 200 events).

### entity_filter

Instead of specifying a single entity, write a text filter. The card finds all entities whose ID or friendly name contains the filter text and creates one alert per match:

```yaml
- entity_filter: "battery"
  attribute: battery_level
  operator: "<="
  state: "20"
  message: "Low battery: {name} ({state}%)"
  theme: battery
  entity_filter_exclude:
    - sensor.battery_test_device
```

**Message placeholders:**

| Placeholder | Replaced with |
|---|---|
| `{name}` | Entity friendly name |
| `{entity}` | Entity ID |
| `{state}` | Current state value (translated) |
| `{device}` | HA device name from the device registry |
| `{timer}` | Live countdown for `timer.*` entities (`mm:ss` / `h:mm:ss`) |

The matched entity's friendly name is also automatically shown below the message so you always know which device triggered the alert.

### HA template syntax in messages

The `message` field (and `secondary_text`) supports **full Jinja2 template syntax** — rendered server-side by Home Assistant via the WebSocket API, with live updates whenever entities change.

```yaml
# Simple sensor value
- entity: sensor.co2_ppm
  operator: ">"
  state: "1000"
  message: "CO₂: {{ states('sensor.co2_ppm') }} ppm"

# Attribute value
- entity: climate.hvac
  state: heating
  message: "Heating — room: {{ state_attr('climate.hvac', 'current_temperature') }}°"

# Conditional logic
- entity: sensor.battery_phone
  operator: "<"
  state: "20"
  message: >
    {% if states('sensor.battery_phone') | int < 10 %}
      Critical: {{ states('sensor.battery_phone') }}%
    {% else %}
      Low battery: {{ states('sensor.battery_phone') }}%
    {% endif %}

# Time / date
- entity: binary_sensor.night_mode
  state: "on"
  message: "Night mode active since {{ now().strftime('%H:%M') }}"

# Math / unit conversion
- entity: sensor.power_consumption
  operator: ">"
  state: "2000"
  message: "High consumption: {{ (states('sensor.power_consumption') | float / 1000) | round(2) }} kW"
```

Any template that works in HA automations and template sensors works here too.

**Editor preview:** type a filter text and a live counter shows how many entities match. Click the counter to expand a full list with names, entity IDs and current states. Click any entity to exclude it (✗) or re-include it (✓).

### Timer themes

Select a `timer.*` entity and use one of the 4 dedicated timer themes. The card reads `finishes_at` from the timer attributes and updates the display every second:

```yaml
- entity: timer.ad_blocker_paused
  state: active
  message: "Ad blocking disabled for {timer}"
  theme: countdown
```

Use `{timer}` in the message to display the live countdown (`mm:ss` or `h:mm:ss`).

When a timer entity is selected in the editor, `state` is automatically set to `active` and the theme switches to `countdown`.

### Numeric / comparison conditions

```yaml
- entity: sensor.co2_ppm
  operator: ">"
  state: "1000"
  message: "CO₂ level critical!"
```

Supported operators: `=` (default), `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `contains`, `not_contains`.

### Attribute-based triggers

```yaml
- entity: sensor.phone
  attribute: battery_level
  operator: "<"
  state: "20"
  message: "Phone battery critical"
  theme: battery
```

### AND / OR multi-entity conditions

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.front_door
  state: "on"
  conditions_logic: "and"
  conditions:
    - entity: input_boolean.night_mode
      operator: "="
      state: "on"
  message: "Door open at night"
  theme: intruder
```

- `and` — all conditions must match (default)
- `or` — at least one condition must match

### HA icons (mdi:)

Enable the `use_ha_icon` toggle per alert to use a native HA icon instead of an emoji. When enabled, the card first reads the entity's icon from the HA entity registry — so you get the correct icon automatically without setting it manually. You can also pick any `mdi:` or `hass:` icon from the native HA icon picker in the editor. Combine with `icon_color` to tint the icon with any CSS color.

### Message placeholders

`{state}`, `{name}`, `{entity}`, and `{device}` work in the `message` field of **any** alert that has an entity set — not just `entity_filter` alerts:

```yaml
- entity: sensor.meter_abe4
  operator: "<="
  state: "20"
  message: "Battery low: {state}%"
  secondary_text: "Device: {device}"
```

### secondary_text

A static second line displayed below the message. Supports placeholders. Does not require a secondary entity:

```yaml
secondary_text: "Zone: {name} — Current: {state}"
```

### Badge customization

Hide the category badge or replace its text:

```yaml
show_badge: false        # hide completely
badge_label: "URGENT"   # or use a custom label
```

### Sound notifications

Play an audio tone when an alert becomes active. Uses the Web Audio API — no files required for the default tones:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.smoke_detector
  state: "on"
  message: "Smoke detected!"
  sound: true
  sound_url: "https://example.com/alarm.mp3"  # optional custom sound
```

Default tones by category: Critical = double high beep · Warning = medium beep · Info = soft beep · OK = rising chime.

> **Note:** requires browser autoplay permission. Works out of the box on wall-mounted tablets with HA Companion.

### Large buttons

Always-visible pill-shaped 💤 and 📋 buttons — useful for wall-mounted tablets where hover is not available:

```yaml
large_buttons: true
```

### Swipe to snooze

Enable a left-swipe gesture to snooze the current alert on touch devices. Works independently of `tap_action` and `hold_action` — no conflict:

```yaml
swipe_to_snooze: true
```

Swipe at least 60 px horizontally to trigger. Uses the configured `snooze_duration` (or 1 h if none is set).

### Vertical layout

Stack the icon on top and the message below, centered — useful for narrow columns or square card grids:

```yaml
vertical: true
```

Works with all 40 themes. The **Ticker** theme keeps its horizontal scrolling. Can be combined with `ha_theme: true` and `large_buttons: true`.

### HA theme adaptation

Adapt the card's color palette to the active Home Assistant global theme:

```yaml
ha_theme: true
```

When enabled:
- Card background → `--card-background-color`
- Text → `--primary-text-color` / `--secondary-text-color`
- Critical badges/borders → `--error-color`
- Warning badges/borders → `--warning-color`
- Info badges/borders → `--info-color`
- OK badges/borders → `--success-color`

All 40 visual themes retain their animations and layouts — only the color palette adapts. Compatible with Mushroom, Material, iOS, and any custom HA theme.

### Overlay / toast notification

Enable a global floating banner that fires when a new alert triggers — **visible from any dashboard view**, not just the one where the card lives:

```yaml
overlay_mode: true
overlay_position: top     # top | center | bottom
overlay_duration: 8       # seconds before auto-dismiss (0 = manual close only)
```

How it works:
- When the card's view is **currently visible**, the banner is suppressed (no redundant notification — the card itself already shows the alert).
- When you navigate away to another view (or the card is off-screen), an independent watcher reads entity states from the always-present `<home-assistant>` element every 2 seconds and fires the banner automatically.
- A 10-second deduplication window prevents the same alert from firing twice.
- The banner is styled according to the alert category (Critical / Warning / Info / OK / Style / Timer) and dismisses automatically after `overlay_duration` seconds, or manually via the × button.

Position options:
| Value | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `top` | Slides in from the top of the screen |
| `center` | Pops in at the center of the screen (scale animation) |
| `bottom` | Slides in from the bottom of the screen |

### Card border

Enable a persistent visible border around the card using the standard HA border style:

```yaml
card_border: true
```

Default: `false` (off). Uses `--ha-card-border-width` and `--ha-card-border-color` from the active HA theme. When `card_border` is on and the card is otherwise hidden (no alerts, `show_when_clear` off), a subtle dashed placeholder with a 🔔 icon is shown so the card remains discoverable and editable.

### Test mode

Force all configured alerts to display as active — useful for previewing the card appearance without waiting for real conditions:

```yaml
test_mode: true
```

> Remember to remove `test_mode` before going live. A yellow banner is shown on the card as a reminder.

In the visual editor, open the **Alerts tab** → enable **Test mode** at the bottom → expand any alert to instantly preview it on the card.

## Troubleshooting

**Card not appearing after installation**
- Add `alert-ticker-card.js` as a JavaScript module in Settings → Dashboards → Resources
- Hard-reload the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

**Features not working after update (secondary text, templates, new options)**
- HA and browsers cache custom card files aggressively. After updating, always do a **hard-reload** (`Ctrl+Shift+R` / `Cmd+Shift+R`) or go to **Settings → System → Restart → Clear cache and restart**. You can verify the running version by searching for `CARD_VERSION` in the JS file via browser DevTools.

**Entity picker not showing in editor**
- Known HA lazy-loading issue. The card handles it automatically. If it still doesn't appear, close and reopen the editor.

**Card disappears when alerts resolve**
- Set `show_when_clear: true` to keep the card visible.

**Trigger state not matching**
- State values are case-sensitive exact strings. Use the live **Current state** hint in the editor or check Developer Tools → States.

**Timer not updating**
- Ensure the timer entity state is `active`. The card reads `finishes_at` from the timer attributes. If `finishes_at` is missing, the countdown shows `--:--`.

**entity_filter matching too many entities**
- Use a more specific filter text, or click individual entities in the editor preview list to exclude them.

**Weather widget shows placeholder but entity is configured**
- Make sure `clear_display_mode` is set to `weather` or `weather_clock` AND `clear_weather_entity` points to a valid `weather.*` entity.
