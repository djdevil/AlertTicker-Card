# AlertTicker Card for Home Assistant

A custom Lovelace card to display alerts and notifications based on entity states. Supports **17 visual themes** with per-alert theme assignment, 3D fold animation cycling, priority ordering, and a complete visual editor — all without writing a single line of YAML.

## Themes

Themes are grouped by category. Selecting a theme automatically sets the matching icon and default message. You can always override the icon with any emoji.

### 🚨 Critical

| Theme | Icon | Visual style |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `emergency` | 🚨 | Dark red card with pulsing red glow and flashing siren icon |
| `fire` | 🔥 | Deep orange card with flame flicker animation |
| `alarm` | 🔴 | Black card with rapid red strobe effect |
| `lightning` | 🌩️ | Dark purple card with electric glow and lightning flash |

### ⚠️ Warning

| Theme | Icon | Visual style |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `warning` | ⚠️ | Dark amber card with orange left border and pulsing dot |
| `caution` | 🟡 | Black/yellow card with diagonal stripe bar and blinking dot |

### ℹ️ Info

| Theme | Icon | Visual style |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `info` | ℹ️ | Dark blue card with blue left border and circular icon wrap |

| `aurora` | 🌌 | Dark card with shifting aurora gradient background |

### ✅ OK / All Clear

| Theme | Icon | Visual style |

## How It Works

### Alert lifecycle

1. You configure one or more **alerts**, each linked to an entity + trigger state
2. When an entity reaches its trigger state, the alert becomes **active**
3. Active alerts are **sorted by priority** (1=most critical)
4. The card **displays** the highest-priority active alert
5. If multiple alerts are active, it **auto-cycles** through them with a 3D fold transition
6. When no alerts are active and `show_when_clear: true`, the card shows the **all-clear message**
7. When no alerts are active and `show_when_clear: false`, the **card hides itself** completely

### Per-alert theme

Each alert in the list has its own `theme` field. This means:
- Alert 1 (power outage) → `emergency` (red, pulsing)
- Alert 2 (door open) → `caution` (yellow stripes)
- Alert 3 (firmware update) → `info` (blue)

They all coexist on the same card and cycle between each other automatically.

### Theme → icon coherence

When you select a theme in the editor, the icon is automatically set to the theme's default:
- `emergency` → 🚨, `fire` → 🔥, `alarm` → 🔴, `lightning` → 🌩️
- `warning` → ⚠️, `caution` → 🟡
- `info` → ℹ️, `notification` → 🔔, `aurora` → 🌌
- `success` → ✅, `check` → 🟢, `confetti` → 🎉
- `ticker` → 📰, `neon` → ⚡, `glass` → 🔮, `matrix` → 💻, `minimal` → 📋

You can override any icon with a custom emoji in the `icon` field.

### Priority system

Alerts are sorted automatically. You only configure the priority number — the card does the rest.

| Priority | Label | Auto-sort position | Typical use case |
|----------|-------|--------------------|-----------------|
| `1` | Critical | First | Power outage, fire alarm, intrusion detected |
| `2` | Warning | Second | Door left open, water leak, low battery |
| `3` | Info | Third | Firmware update available, calendar reminder |
| `4` | Low | Last | Routine notifications, status messages |

When two alerts share the same priority, they appear in configuration order.

### Auto-cycle with 3D fold animation

When multiple alerts are active:
- A **counter** (e.g. `2/3`) appears in the top-right corner
- The card waits `cycle_interval` seconds, then plays a **3D fold-out** animation
- The content swaps to the next alert in priority order
- A **fold-in** animation reveals the new alert
- The loop continues indefinitely until alerts are resolved

The `ticker` theme is the exception — it scrolls all active alerts simultaneously in a single bar without cycling.

### All-clear state

When `show_when_clear: true`:
- The card remains visible even when no alerts are active
- It shows a configurable `clear_message` (e.g. "Everything is fine")
- It uses the `clear_theme` to style the all-clear card (limited to OK themes)
- This is useful to confirm to the user that the card is working and there is genuinely nothing to worry about

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=djdevil&repository=AlertTicker-Card&category=plugin)

1. Click the button above **or** open **HACS → Frontend**
2. Click **⋮ → Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/djdevil/AlertTicker-Card` as type **Lovelace**
4. Find **AlertTicker Card** and click **Download**
5. **Reload** your browser

### Manual

1. Download `alert-ticker-card.js` and `alert-ticker-card-editor.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/djdevil/AlertTicker-Card/releases)
2. Copy both files to `/config/www/`
3. Go to **Settings → Dashboards → Resources**
4. Add `/local/alert-ticker-card.js` as a **JavaScript module**
5. **Reload** the browser

---

## Visual Editor

No YAML knowledge required. The editor has two tabs:

### General tab

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Cycle interval** | How many seconds between alerts when multiple are active (default: 5) |
| **Show when no alerts** | Toggle to keep the card visible when everything is OK |
| **Message when clear** | Text to show in the all-clear state |
| **Theme for all-clear** | Visual theme for the all-clear card (OK themes only) |

### Alerts tab

For each alert you can configure:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Entity** | Select any entity from your HA instance via the native entity picker |
| **Trigger state** | The state value that activates the alert (e.g. `on`, `off`, `unavailable`) |
| **Priority** | 1 (Critical) → 4 (Low) |
| **Message** | The text displayed when this alert is active. Pre-filled with a theme default |
| **Theme** | Visual theme for this specific alert |
| **Icon** | Optional emoji override — leave empty for automatic icon from theme |

You can **reorder** alerts with the ↑ Su / ↓ Giù buttons. The priority number is what controls display order in the card — the list order in the editor is just for your own organisation.

## Languages

The card automatically detects the language from your Home Assistant settings (`configuration.yaml → homeassistant: language`). No manual configuration needed.

| Language | Code | Fallback |
|----------|------|---------|
| Italian | `it` | — |
| English | `en` | ✅ default |
| French | `fr` | — |
| German | `de` | — |

All UI labels, category names, default messages, and editor strings are fully translated in all four languages. Any unsupported language automatically falls back to English.

## Technical Notes

### Entity picker in the editor

The card uses the native `ha-entity-picker` component from Home Assistant. This component is loaded lazily by HA. To ensure it is available when the editor opens, the card uses the `hui-glance-card.getConfigElement()` technique — the standard community pattern for forcing HA to load the picker before the editor renders.

### Cache busting

Both `alert-ticker-card.js` and `alert-ticker-card-editor.js` use `import.meta.url` with a `?v=` version query parameter. This ensures browsers always load the latest version after an update, even if the file is cached.

### Performance

The `set hass()` setter uses a **signature string** (all entity IDs concatenated with their current states) to detect whether any relevant entity has changed. If the signature is identical to the previous update, the re-render is skipped entirely. This avoids unnecessary DOM updates when unrelated entities change in HA.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Card not appearing after installation**
- Make sure you added `alert-ticker-card.js` as a JavaScript module resource in Settings → Dashboards → Resources
- Hard-reload the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

**Entity picker not showing in editor**
- This is a known HA lazy-loading issue. The card handles it automatically via `hui-glance-card.getConfigElement()`. If it still doesn't appear, try closing and reopening the editor.

**Card disappears when alerts resolve**
- This is by design. Set `show_when_clear: true` to keep the card visible with an all-clear message.

**Trigger state not matching**
- State values are case-sensitive and must be exact strings. Check the entity state in Developer Tools → States. Common values: `"on"`, `"off"`, `"unavailable"`, `"home"`, `"away"`, `"triggered"`.

**All alerts cycling too fast**
- Increase `cycle_interval`. Minimum is 1 second, recommended is 5–10 seconds.
