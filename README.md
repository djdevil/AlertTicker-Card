## How It Works

### Alert lifecycle

1. Configure one or more **alerts**, each linked to an entity + condition
2. When an entity matches the condition (and any extra `conditions` rules), the alert becomes **active**
3. Active alerts are **sorted by priority** (1=most critical)
4. The card **displays** the current alert and **auto-cycles** through multiple active alerts
5. **Tap** or **hold** the card to execute configured actions
6. **Snooze** any alert with 💤 — one tap for fixed duration, or choose from the menu
7. **📋** opens the alert history with timestamps
8. When no alerts are active and `show_when_clear: true`, the card shows the **all-clear message**

### Transition animations

When multiple alerts are active, the card cycles using the selected animation:

| Animation | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `fold` *(default)* | 3D page-turn along the X axis |
| `slide` | Horizontal push left/right |
| `fade` | Cross-dissolve opacity fade |
| `flip` | RotateY card flip |
| `zoom` | Scale punch in/out |
| `glitch` | Clip-path jitter digital noise |
| `bounce` | Elastic spring from below |
| `swing` | RotateZ pendulum |
| `blur` | Gaussian dissolve |
| `split` | Vertical split (top up, bottom down) |
| `roll` | RotateY + translateX combined roll |
| `curtain` | Opens from center (theater curtain) |

### Secondary entity value

Display a live entity value as a second line below the alert message:

```yaml
- entity: sensor.open_zones
  operator: "!="
  state: "0"
  message: "Zones open"
  secondary_entity: sensor.open_zones_list
  secondary_attribute: zone_names   # optional — read an attribute instead of state
```

### tap_action / hold_action

Standard Lovelace interactions — tap or hold (500 ms) the whole card to trigger any action:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.front_door
  state: "on"
  message: "Front door open"
  tap_action:
    action: more-info
    entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
  hold_action:
    action: navigate
    navigation_path: /lovelace/security
```

Supported action types: `call-service`, `navigate`, `more-info`, `url`, `none`.

### Snooze

Tap 💤 on any active alert to snooze it. Two modes (configurable in General tab):

- **Menu** *(default)* — choose 1h / 4h / 8h / 24h from a menu on the card
- **Fixed duration** — configure 30min / 1h / 4h / 8h / 24h for immediate one-tap snooze

Snoozed alerts persist in `localStorage` and the card restores them automatically when the duration expires. A small amber 💤 pill appears when some alerts are snoozed while others remain active — tap it to resume all.

### snooze_action

Execute a Lovelace action when the 💤 button is tapped, in addition to snoozing. Useful for resetting sensors:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.mailbox
  state: "on"
  message: "Mail arrived"
  snooze_action:
    action: call-service
    service: input_boolean.turn_off
    target:
      entity_id: input_boolean.mailbox_flag
```

### Alert history

Tap 📋 to flip the card and view a timestamped log of every alert that became active. Includes a Clear button. History is stored in `localStorage` (configurable max: 25 / 50 / 100 / 200 events).

### entity_filter

Instead of specifying a single entity, write a text filter. The card finds all entities whose ID or friendly name contains the filter text and creates one alert per match:

```yaml
- entity_filter: "battery"
  attribute: battery_level
  operator: "<="
  state: "20"
  message: "Low battery: {name} ({state}%)"
  theme: battery
  entity_filter_exclude:
    - sensor.battery_test_device
```

**Message placeholders:**

| Placeholder | Replaced with |
|---|---|
| `{name}` | Entity friendly name |
| `{entity}` | Entity ID |
| `{state}` | Current state value |

The matched entity's friendly name is also automatically shown below the message so you always know which device triggered the alert.

**Editor preview:** type a filter text and a live counter shows how many entities match. Click the counter to expand a full list with names, entity IDs and current states. Click any entity to exclude it (✗) or re-include it (✓).

### Timer themes

Select a `timer.*` entity and use one of the 4 dedicated timer themes. The card reads `finishes_at` from the timer attributes and updates the display every second:

```yaml
- entity: timer.ad_blocker_paused
  state: active
  message: "Ad blocking disabled for {timer}"
  theme: countdown
```

Use `{timer}` in the message to display the live countdown (`mm:ss` or `h:mm:ss`).

When a timer entity is selected in the editor, `state` is automatically set to `active` and the theme switches to `countdown`.

### Numeric / comparison conditions

```yaml
- entity: sensor.co2_ppm
  operator: ">"
  state: "1000"
  message: "CO₂ level critical!"
```

Supported operators: `=` (default), `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.

### Attribute-based triggers

```yaml
- entity: sensor.phone
  attribute: battery_level
  operator: "<"
  state: "20"
  message: "Phone battery critical"
  theme: battery
```

### AND / OR multi-entity conditions

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.front_door
  state: "on"
  conditions_logic: "and"
  conditions:
    - entity: input_boolean.night_mode
      operator: "="
      state: "on"
  message: "Door open at night"
  theme: intruder
```

- `and` — all conditions must match (default)
- `or` — at least one condition must match

### HA icons (mdi:)

Enable the `use_ha_icon` toggle per alert to use a native HA icon instead of an emoji. When enabled, the icon is automatically read from the entity's attributes. You can also pick any `mdi:` or `hass:` icon from the native HA icon picker in the editor.

### Message placeholders

`{state}`, `{name}`, and `{entity}` work in the `message` field of **any** alert that has an entity set — not just `entity_filter` alerts:

```yaml
- entity: sensor.meter_abe4
  operator: "<="
  state: "20"
  message: "Battery low: {state}%"
  secondary_text: "Device: {name}"
```

### secondary_text

A static second line displayed below the message. Supports placeholders. Does not require a secondary entity:

```yaml
secondary_text: "Zone: {name} — Current: {state}"
```

### Badge customization

Hide the category badge or replace its text:

```yaml
show_badge: false        # hide completely
badge_label: "URGENT"   # or use a custom label
```

### Sound notifications

Play an audio tone when an alert becomes active. Uses the Web Audio API — no files required for the default tones:

```yaml
- entity: binary_sensor.smoke_detector
  state: "on"
  message: "Smoke detected!"
  sound: true
  sound_url: "https://example.com/alarm.mp3"  # optional custom sound
```

Default tones by category: Critical = double high beep · Warning = medium beep · Info = soft beep · OK = rising chime.

> **Note:** requires browser autoplay permission. Works out of the box on wall-mounted tablets with HA Companion.

### Large buttons

Always-visible pill-shaped 💤 and 📋 buttons — useful for wall-mounted tablets where hover is not available:

```yaml
large_buttons: true
```

### Test mode

Force all configured alerts to display as active — useful for previewing the card appearance without waiting for real conditions:

```yaml
test_mode: true
```

> Remember to remove `test_mode` before going live. A yellow banner is shown on the card as a reminder.

In the visual editor, open the **Alerts tab** → enable **Test mode** at the bottom → expand any alert to instantly preview it on the card.

## Languages

The card automatically detects the language from your Home Assistant settings.

| Language | Code | Fallback |
|----------|------|---------|
| Italian | `it` | — |
| English | `en` | ✅ default |
| French | `fr` | — |
| German | `de` | — |
| Dutch | `nl` | — |
| Vietnamese | `vi` | — |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Card not appearing after installation**
- Add `alert-ticker-card.js` as a JavaScript module in Settings → Dashboards → Resources
- Hard-reload the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)

**Entity picker not showing in editor**
- Known HA lazy-loading issue. The card handles it automatically. If it still doesn't appear, close and reopen the editor.

**Card disappears when alerts resolve**
- Set `show_when_clear: true` to keep the card visible.

**Trigger state not matching**
- State values are case-sensitive exact strings. Use the live **Current state** hint in the editor or check Developer Tools → States.

**Timer not updating**
- Ensure the timer entity state is `active`. The card reads `finishes_at` from the timer attributes. If `finishes_at` is missing, the countdown shows `--:--`.

**entity_filter matching too many entities**
- Use a more specific filter text, or click individual entities in the editor preview list to exclude them.
